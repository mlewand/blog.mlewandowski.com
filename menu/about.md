My name is Marek Lewandowski, I'm a programmer, gamer, musician who also loves to play around with all sort of electronic parts.

Professionally I've been a programmer since 2009, while my hobby-programming journey started back in 2004. I've been programming in JavaScript, Python 3, PHP, C++, ActionScript 3.

Currently I'm a CKEditor 4 Lead Developer at [CKSource](http://cksource.com/).
